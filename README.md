# Power BI Project Inventory-Supply Chain Analysis
Transformed inventory management by building an interactive Power BI dashboard that slashed stockouts by 3% and improved supplier on-time delivery by 7%. The tool provides real-time insights into demand forecasting and logistics, driving data-driven decisions across the supply chain.
